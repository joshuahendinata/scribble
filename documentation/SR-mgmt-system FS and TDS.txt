=======================
Functional Specs
=======================
Glossary:
1. Request: a request from devs/leads
2. SR: a service request that has been raised 

Scope of system: Only for C2IS-CSI SR


- System will capture: 
Incident ID, 
Request description, 
Request instruction + attachment, 
Request category: Batch log (with date), App Log (with date), DB Query, DB patch, BPM query, BPM patch
Request requested by (devs),
Request Date,
SR raised by (leads), 
SR raised date, 
SR no. used, 
SR documents (upload),  
Status: No Action, Raised, Cancelled

- Developer can create and update SR as long as it is not raised

- Leads can choose an SR and raise it. A sequence number will be generated to be used

- Small text field to search for keywords. It will be checked against all column, except dates (just like outlook mailbox search)

- Search between request date or SR raised date

- The main table can be searched per column (like SQL developer)

- The main table will be lazily loaded 10, 20, 30 records per page


3 Pages
- Main pages with tables and search fields
- Create page
- Update page

2 Type of users
- Devs: can request for SR, can update non-raised SR (anyone or their own only?)
- Leads: all devs functionality + choosing SR and change the status to anything

Core functionality
- File management (upload/download)
- Create and update
- View and Search
- Simple Login

Technical Specs
=======================
MEAN stack 
Github
Robo 3T for Mongo DB visualization

System will be hosted at Dhany's jenkin's machine

Future implementation
- Auto SR generation using windward
- User admin
